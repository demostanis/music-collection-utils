# music-collection-utils
small scripts to create and order my music collection

- download.sh: downloads a playlist using youtube-dl
- metadata.sh: adds album, artist and title metadata to the music files based on filename
- sort.sh: sorts music files by prefixing them with a number after fetching the right order with youtube-dl
- revert.sh: in case sort didn't work out properly
